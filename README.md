# YouTube-Downloader
This project is a YouTube downloader application GUI designed with the Python language (version 3.10).

It uses the PyQt5 library, a Python binding for the Qt application framework, to create a traditional 
graphical user interface (GUI), consisting of the main window and some dialogs.

To download the YouTube videos, the project uses the pytube library in a secondary thread of execution 
to offload long-running tasks such as downloading videos.

The code for this application has been commented on extensively for learning purposes.
